He's the best type of user, the one that debugs a problem so far so that he tells you exactly what you're doing wrong, and how to fix it." (Brian Bechtel)
In short, Thomas is a guy in his early 50s, with the tendency to be obsessed with details, being of short temper and generally annoying his peers quickly with his attention to detail and want to get everything right.
But that's probably not what you wanted to know if you came to this site. Let's start again.
Thomas has been exploring all kinds of depths in the programming world in the past 30 years, and this page shall give the interested reader a little insight in the achievements a single programmer can obtain.
