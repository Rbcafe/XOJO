With many years of programming, I have taken up interest in the programming language called REALStudio (http://www.realbasic.com). 

I have been programming computers for a little over 25 years, and my favorite languages have been Pascal, Visual Basic, Java and REALStudio.  I am interested in RAD (Rapid Application Development).  Over 99% of all of my programs are highly business and technically based.  Other programming languages are more powerful, but when I need to have a program built in a day, it can be done.

Pascal became obsolete, and this facilitated my change to Visual Basic.  After the complete format change of Visual Basic from 6.0, REALStudio, and Java were the strongest available alternatives. 

Java offers many benefits, including the ability to make executable files on the three major Operating System (OS) platforms (Windows, Linux and Macintosh). 

REALStudio has been increasing the base of programmers by providing many examples and implementing many new and exciting features.  Since I have been programming in Windows (albeit some DOS) based systems for so many years, and so many of my colleagues have this operating system, I am required to follow the masses.
