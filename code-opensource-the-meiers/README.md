# Roger Meier's Open-Source Projects

http://opensource.the-meiers.org

############################################

My name is Roger Meier, and I am NOT a professional programmer. Writing my own programs is a hobby that I picked up when I couldn't find any decent (if at all) freeware or shareware for certain tasks for which I wanted to use a computer. 

I picked Xojo (formerly REALBasic) as my language of choice for several reaons, including its structure, its "object-orientness", its capability to create executables for Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux Platforms, and last but not least for its fairly large and helpful user community.

Here I'm hosting open-source code that may be generally useful. Current open-source projects are listed in the table below. Simply click a project name to download the project archive.

DISCLAIMER: ALL SOURCE CODE IS PUBLIC DOMAIN, AND PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. 

I have also created a number of small Freeware Applications and Tools that you might be interested in.
